This assigment was completed in order to fimilarize yourself with teh Foursqaure API.

After this the data from the webpage was stored in a Pandas dataframe. 
The data was wranggled and cleaned so it would be easier to use. 
Then data from the Foursqaure API was used to find the top 10 venues from each nieghbourhood. 
This data was used to cluster the neighbourhoods, using the k-means algorithm. 
Finally a visualization of the clusters was produced, using the Foluim Library in Pythin.
