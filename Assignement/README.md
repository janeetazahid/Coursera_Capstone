This assignment was completed in order to familiarize yourself with the Foursquare API.

The purpose of this assignment was to scrape a Wikipedia webpage, to obtain the neighborhoods in Toronto. 
After this, the data from the webpage was stored in a Pandas data frame. 
The data was wrangled and cleaned so it would be easier to use. 
Then data from the Foursquare API was used to find the top 10 venues from each neighborhood. 
This data was used to cluster the neighborhoods, using the k-means algorithm. 
Finally, a visualization of the clusters was produced, using the Folium library in Python.

The final part of the project is is under Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods_Part III.ipynb and the link to the project is:
